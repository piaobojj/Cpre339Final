### Goal:
   Expected to perform from high-level architecture design to detailed software development and/or implementation, and applying what we have learned into software development practice. 

### Idea:
   The game will be developed in the 2D scrolling style similar like Raiden Fighter https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsD-FNjPOmk , which the player is required to move it up and down, be able to obstacles the object and doget various kinds of enemies along the way.
   
### Doucmentation:
<ul>
  <li>Deliverable-2 (contains new updated C&C and module decomposition diagram)</li>
  <li>Deliverable-3 (contains new update class and usecas diagram)</li>
  <li>Demo-Video (Briefly describe the design implementation / code sample / actual game play)</li>
  <li>Screenshot (the actual game play overview)</li>
  <li>Handwrite script (chartecter and object design )</li>
</ul> 
### Software Architecture and Design Techniques Use:

  Implement defensive programming
      TODO
      
  Code smells
      TODO
      
  Inter-processes/threads communication
      TODO
      
  Design patterns
      TODO
